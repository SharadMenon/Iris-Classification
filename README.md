# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project is a hands-on implementation of classic machine learning algorithms on the Iris dataset using Scikit-learn. It includes data visualization, classification, and dimensionality reduction for visualizing decision boundaries.

## 📌 What I Learned
- How to use Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and SVM for classification.
- How to visualize model performance using PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
- How to evaluate models using accuracy scores.
- The difference between training models on original vs PCA-reduced features.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- Numpy

## 📊 Visualizations
- Plots comparing decision boundaries of classifiers trained on:
  - Full 4D feature space (projected into 2D using PCA for plotting)
  - 2D PCA-reduced space

## 📁 Files
- `iris_classification.py` – Main script with training, testing, and plotting.
- `README.md` – You're reading it :)

## 🚀 Run It Yourself
```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pandas numpy
python iris_classification.py
